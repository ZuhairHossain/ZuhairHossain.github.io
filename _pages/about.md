Hello, I am <b> Syed Zuhair Hossain </b> (you can call me <b>Zuhair</b>) from <b>Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>. I am a passionate tech-enthusiast with a strong interest in Science and Arts. I am into learning new things about technology and research methodology with an engineering mindset. I have completed my undergrad  in <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> as major at <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">Brac University</a> in May, 2023.

I am currently a <b>Sys</b>tem <b>Ad</b>ministrator at <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://therapbd.com/">Therap (BD) Ltd.</a>, where I work within the Application and Middleware (<b>D</b>evOps) Team. My role involves managing and maintaining the company's systems and infrastructure, while also applying DevOps principles to automate and streamline our software delivery processes.

From February 2023 to September 2025, I worked as a <b>Dev</b>Ops <b>En</b>gineer in the Platform Architecture and Operations Department of ITP Division at  <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.reddotdigitalit.com/">RedDot Digital IT Ltd (subsidiary of Robi Axiata Ltd.)</a>. I was responsible for managing the platform's core infrastructure. To make operations more efficient and reliable, I utilized advanced automation tools like CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Before joining as DevOps engineer, I have completed my undergraduate thesis on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) under the guidance of Assistant Professor, <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nUColk4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Jannatun Noor Mukta</a> in collaboration with Professor, <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K-AIPzQAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. A. B. M. Alim Al Islam</a>, <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8it468kAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Tanjir Rashid Soron</a> and <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S4XSndkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Md. Golam Zel Asmaul Husna</a>. We are honored to received a prestigious <i>research grant</i> from <b>Brac University</b>, which enables us to expand our research work.

My research interests focus on <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>, aiming to solve real-world problems faced by <b>marginalized communities</b> to enhance <b>social good</b>. I am also interested to explore <b>Augmented Reality</b>, <b>Virtual Reality</b> and <b>Computational Social Science</b>. I am actively looking for <b>Research Assistant</b> and <b>Research Collaboration</b> positions in Human Computer Interaction research labs. You can also knock me with positions in Software Engineering industry, mentoring and educational content development opportunities.
